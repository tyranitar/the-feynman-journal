This repository contains the source code for visualizations in [The Feynman Journal](https://www.notion.so/Deep-Learning-Explained-Visually-f7f3ba00be894e6a9f99857bfa26da6b). One such visualization is the following, which shows how a neural network separates data using nonlinear activations:

Here's another visualization, which demonstrates how the chain rule works:

Most of the code is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) notebooks, as Julia is ideal for creating informative animations.
